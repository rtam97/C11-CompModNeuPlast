# C11 - CompModNeuPlast

This repository contains the code and the results of the simulations ran as part of the course:

<p>
  <i>
  C11 - Computational Modeling of Neuronal Plasticity <br>
  Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Master<br>
  Goethe University Frankfurt<br>
  </i>
</p>

Supervisor: [Prof. Dr. Jochen Triesch](https://www.fias.science/en/neuroscience/research-groups/jochen-triesch/)

⚠️ As of 26/01/2022 I have rewritten the entire code so that it is object-oriented. Much easier to run simulations now! ⚠️
